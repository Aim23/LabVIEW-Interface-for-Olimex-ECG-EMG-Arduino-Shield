This folder contains a LabVIEW VI that will read Arduino analog inputs from the Olimex ECG/EMG shield, 
graphically render the readings, and save to file inside the "Recorded Samples" folder. 
Copy the folders inside the "libraries" folder to "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\libraries". 
Upload the ShieldEkgEmgDemo sketch to the Arduino. Then run the "Six Lead ECG Monitor.vi". 
This VI takes some time to start working. It will initially give you a constant 512 output for all 
channels until LabVIEW is synchronized with the Serial Port output from the Arduino. 
At that point the "Current State" field will change from "Initial State" to "Offset Corrected".
You can change the name of the savefile if you like. If you want to put in your own signal processing 
algorithms, do it in the "Consumer Loop" rather than the "Producer Loop". I would like to acknowledge 
that I DID NOT DEVELOP "SheildEkgEmgDemo" Arduino Sketch or the "TimerOne" and "FlexiTimer2" Arduino 
Libraries, and credit belongs to their respective developers. These files were included for your 
convenience so that you can run "Six Lead ECG Monitor.vi"
